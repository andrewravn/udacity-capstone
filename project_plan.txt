Step 1: Propose and Scope the Project

    - Simple web app that stores information (surveys)
        - MEAN
        - MongoDB
    - Container lives in AWS under ECR
    - Cluster lives in AWS under the EKS service 
    - Cluster Pods:
        - Jenkins
        - Data (Mongo)
            - Considerations:
                - Statfulsets to allow for scaling without losing data
        - Backend
            - Considerations:
                - Networking/Communication pipes between Frontend/Data pods
        - Frontend
            - Considerations:
                - Networking/Communication pipes between Frontend/Data pods
                - Views working as expected

Step 2: Use Jenkins, and implement blue/green or rolling deployment.
    - Jenkins to deploy
    - Ansible to deploy cloudformation scripts / helm chart installs
    - Host project container in ECR

Step 3: Pick AWS Kubernetes as a Service, or build your own Kubernetes cluster.
    - Use EKS

Step 4: Build your pipeline


Step 5: Test your pipeline
